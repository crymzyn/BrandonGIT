SSL / Domain Renewal - Phase 2 Items

-----CONSOLIDATED WITH WILMOT LIST------

-x- If they choose to let a domain/ssl expire , I would like to present them with a list of related URL’s and a link to the website removal form below:

https://maritz.service-now.com/com.glideapp.servicecatalog_cat_item_view.do?v=1&sysparm_id=a3e9f38e106fac40ba8705ce6e132815&sysparm_link_parent=2396e43a103e2040ba8705ce6e132839&sysparm_catalog=e0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4&sysparm_catalog_view=catalog_default

95 % of the time, they will need to decom a site when they truly need to let the SSL expire. There are occasions that site requirements change and they need the site, yet they no longer need an SSL so this shouldn’t be required to proceed.

-x- The other item I needed your help with was to gain a list of servers/sites that are related to the URL that relates to the SSL. (ick – I know)

-x- Also on the let expire a task should be kicked out to WSO to remove domain from DNS.
