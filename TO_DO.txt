TO DO...

GO TIME (FIC):
Inbound Alerts:
-x- Create REST jobs to get records (Windows & Linux)
-x- Place records in Inbound File Integrity Checks
-x- Business rules in IFIC to kick off workflow
-x- Workflow checks against CHG to see if we have one
-x- Workflow checks against rule set to make sure we are concerned
-x- Workflow opens incident if needed
-x- Create entry in Automation Log table

Rule Mgmt:
-- Import rule entries from Paul's CSV files (Windows & Linux) 50%
-x- Discover wwwroot folders and add those (if I can for this stage) 
-- Daily job to run these against Windows servers (Linux manual for now) 50%
-- Open incident to FIC group or Windows/Linux Ops according to error from script
-- Create entries in Rule Deployment table

PROJECT LOPAN
- Assume we have user object in SN and tied to dept
- Use dept role to provision rest of account and hardware

-- Prevent user from selecting deployment date in past
-- Update 'let expire' workflow stuff
-- On the let expire a task should be kicked out to WSO to remove domain from DNS
-- Does cert info back from Digi give new expiration date?  Need to populate CI record with that to ensure validity.
-- 
Standard Maintenance Windows:
Wednesday 00:00:00 - 06:00:00
Sunday 00:00:00 - 06:00:00
		alertInvalidTime += '\n\nIf the install needs to occur outside of the typical maintenance schedule, please check the \'Assistance Required\' option and you will be allowed to enter your desired date/time.';

DOMAIN NAME:

-- STATUS TRACKING ON RITM - can they see?  HIDE.
-- 7 day job - same as 21 day job, but escalate
-- Biz rule to mark inactive - day after expiry
-- Check prod domain 'let expires' to make sure to update stats on u_domain_name_renewals
-- Kill workflow activities on contact change?

-2- Client-owned - business rule 1 week after expiration to check if valid 
-2- Pricing Module - workflow is created, just have to create table for data to be placed and parse
	-- Ability to do more than just .COM`
-2- Report for domains that are not included in job (!ENOM !COM) - Tonya

-x- Notifications - email (easy) ---------- need to use close email if I can
	-- Extend email is GOOD
	-- Change email is GOOD
	-- Expire email is GOOD
-x- Logging up front to see when job kicks off - GOOD
-x- Inactive when expiring - GOOD
-x- Hide save button
-x- Up front check to see if domain name even needs to be renewed
-x- Ask Lara how to kill other tasks in workflow when one fork is satisfied
-x- Update u_maint_notes in CI record
-x- only do .COMs
-x- Comments field on emails - "Comments: (Enter billing GL here if required)"

	-x- Make project/task mandatory
	-x- If other selected, make comments mandatory as well
-x- Domains good up to 2.7.15 (they have been opened) - turn job on to run Sun morn (1.18.15)
-x- 21 day job - turn on and client-owned goes to SYSTEM FEED

DNS CLEANUP (ADD-ON):

-- another to add to the list, is DNS cleanup. We need to discuss this. I think a job should kick out monthly to list all domains that were marked inactive for the prior month to be reviewed before a script removes the domains feom DNS (cleanup job will need to be kicked off for all inactive domains to start fresh)

CONCEPT BUILD:

-- Rebecca Diaz email - check it out...  more
