Dear Christina,

Thank you for the letter, and for mostly being kind in its words.  I studied each part and read it twice to make sure I understood your words.  Now, I guess I just have to figure out a way to hold your attention, as I have some important things to say.  First, I'm in love with two women.  It is hard for me to say, but it is the truth.  Before you blow a gasket, as this is not comedy, both women are you.  For what it is worth, you are probably in love with two of me.  Hopefully no one outside of me, but alas, I cannot control that.  All I can do is try to make one or the other of me, better than any other man you come in contact with.  Contact is a key word here, and we will revisit later.  For now, we'll stay on track...  

Two yous...  You two...  You and your shadow.  I'm really not all that complicated, when you figure me up.  At least, in my mind.  Which is why it troubles me that I feel as if I am coated in woman repellant.  I say this because I had a really difficult time figuring women out in general.  I was always told as a child (thank you mom) to treat a woman with respect, give her more love than you think you can, and never leave her side.  Be strong for her, love her like it is your last day here on Earth, never strike her, try to keep patience with her, tell her she's beautiful, and make her the only one.  Gammies and mom used to rave about me, how handsome I was, and some of the other older gals at Tri-County would do the same.  It made me happy.  Then high school came.  Bitches ripped me apart.  What I was told was a terrible lie, I thought.  Even back then, I forgave easily, so I tried to figure out how to fix me instead of blaming everyone else.  I wandered for years, horribly scarred by it all, disfigured and cut off from the rest of society.  Why wouldn't a girl love me?  Why was I always made fun of or avoided?  Was I that ugly, fat, what?  So, I found music.  I found art.  I found what ended up being the core of Brandon.  Some say only when you have lost everything, will you know the real you.  I didn't even have a chance to know any sort of ego.  Still to this day, I have trouble supporting the Brandon brand.  Not in an unhealthy way, in my mind, it is very healthy to keep yourself stripped and humble.  I lash myself daily to keep everything focused.

You know my history, and how women treated me.  I know your history, and how men treated you.  We are both mostly respectful to each others 'things', as they are just that...  'things'.  I bear the weight of demons that chant, 'she's happy with other men', 'she's touching other men', 'she's at another man's house', 'she just got a wonderful gift from the mother of a man she slept with'.  I have my demons, no doubt.  While I try to tame them, they...  just like your demons...  play hell on me.  On top of dealing with them, I deal with the ones that play strings between us.  'She just bashed you, and you want to kiss her?', 'why bother, she'll just hurt you again', 'her mother and her are keeping secrets from you', 'forget the sex, we're all angry here!'...  and I fight a vicious battle with them, quite often.  They are what cause the divide.  They are the builders of grudges.  They can destroy us, if we let them.  

My feminine side...  because I have one that is more prevalent than most men...  she's a bitch, too.  You want to know why I didn't look at you in the sweater and compliment you?  Very simple.  You broke my world apart earlier in the day.  Shattered like a stupid little snow globe.  Maybe I'm too feminine and get my feelings hurt to easily, or maybe I've learned the female game from living with them most of my life, without my father.  I don't know.  But I do know this...  if you think for one second I would make love to someone I'm upset with, you've got it all wrong.  The opposite of fighting is not fucking.  Sorry.  The opposite of fighting, is loving.  Love comes before MAKING love.  Maybe my woman switch is a little tougher than yours, or maybe it is just as tough.  I try to touch you, to kiss you, to make you happy when you are mad...  it hardly ever works.  So you're saying I should just throw you on the bed and fuck you?  Doubtful, but just checking.  Same goes for me...  you and I had an argument earlier, after which I received a novel of text messages outlining how shitty I am.  And you want a compliment on a garment?  PffffHAA!  The woman in me says 'go fuck yourself'.  The man in me still notices how beautiful you are, and I believe he asked you to put the green earrings on with the red sweater, but was upset when you came back in with the same fucking earrings in.  Perhaps you misunderstood - I didn't stay upset very long.  Just note how I have needs, I have feelings, I have wants, all which sometimes go unfulfilled.  And it is okay.  You are human.  Just do not forget that I am human too.  The only way we'll survive this is through forgiveness.  Instant forgiveness.

On top of all the rest, when I'm upset - I cannot work.  I suck at it when I'm riddled with the little asshole demons, who run around picking at my mind.  Most of the time, it is a dog pile.  You have a knack for adding to it as well, at the wrong times.  Example, last night when you 'hawked' me and pointed out that I should be playing with him instead of checking my phone.  You 'hawked' me when he was trying to talk to me.  Trust me, Desmond is the core of my happiness, as I'm sure he is yours as well.  I was just checking my phone when you had looked, all the other time was spent racing cars, building tracks, etc.  The percentage of time was awesome, yet I'm getting a dick in the ass for checking one time.  Later in the evening, I view you in the living room, with a little worse percentage.  The demons say, 'probably talking to another man!'  Well, whatever.  You can study me all you like, you can try to catch me in mistakes all you like, and you can pounce on me all you like...  but it is not a turn on.  Sorry.  If you ever ask yourself why I'm not being loving toward you, check your notes for the day and see if you've somehow hurt me...  think hard, as this is something you need to remember.  I'm not a robot, and I should not be expected to act like one.  

I am also not a horse.  I do not want to live in fear of the whip if I take my eyes off the road.  There is a world around me, and I, just like any other human, love to see all of the magic it brings.  I love to hear it, smell it, taste it, as well.  I like to breathe in life.  I get good fresh air of life, usually right before you punch me in the gut.  'Why is he looking over there' your demons ask of you.  'There's a woman over there!  HE'S STARING AT HER!  KILL HIM!' - sometimes they're so loud, that I can hear them.  I get it...  I just don't know how to defend myself against them when you join in with them.  This is some weird thing that has existed between men and women for a long time, I think.  Throw in that Hollywood, magazines, and such have expanded the issue.  It is just like any other form of habit...  can be manipulated and exhausted, broken and misused.  Let me give you an example...  Our latest journey to Cracker Barrel.  Each time we go out, I live in a heightened state of mind about things...  fear, if you will, that you will get upset about something and thus, our trip is ruined.  I notice things, with these senses, and I take notes.  I try to do everything I can to keep you smiling, as always.  You, are quite comical through it.  I'm sure it is tough being you, with all the demon jackoffs in your ear...  and because you're not flirting with any men, I can sit there with mine silent and watch your every move.  As I watch, I see you 'hawking', I see you doing things that are completely driven by this madness, such as seating yourself at the table where you think has the most view, so that I am not 'enticed' to look.  If you could have me sit in the corner and eat, I think you would.  And that's fine, I like the corner.  What I do not like, is that after we've gone through all of the motions, we get seated, we order, we are having fun, and then you ask if I'm smiling at a some girls off in the distance.  WHAT?  You must be joking.  You're not.  Great.  And my demons drop their card game in the back of my head, come rushing forward, and say 'FUCK THIS!', 'She does worse to you, Brandon, don't let this go!', 'You weren't smiling at them, yell at her!'...  Instead, I hold them off, and explain with a tired voice that I was smiling at my son.  As a matter of fact, yes I did notice the two you were speaking of and made it a point to keep my eyes shut down for that direction for you.  But what good did it do?  NONE.  So, you tell me...  how should I be in public?  What other hoops do you need me to entertain with?  I just don't understand, I'm damned to hell no matter what I do.  I've adapted the best I can to what you need from me, and it does not pay any dividends...  EVER.  

As my demons mentioned...  I could care less if you look and drool at other men.  Just don't touch, try not to flirt and lead them on.  Well, sorry...  but you fail a lot.  However, instead of me getting bent out of shape and attacking you, I keep it in and let it beat the hell out of me.  I contain it, let it explode, and try to protect you from any fragments.  I don't want to make this a war of our insecurities, so I really, really try to not even mention it.  Like, learning last night that you are cutting Jake's hair today.  If I was working on another woman's laptop...  oh, fuck it, never mind.  It's worthless for me to even bring up, because you wouldn't care if I didn't mention to you, right?  Right.  Lets also say that when this woman is around us, I hug up, I chitter chatter smiling and blinking my eyes, I joke and prod, I play delightfully with her while you watch.  I tell her to tell her mom that I love her and miss her.  Add in whatever else you think might be appropriate here, I'm tired of listing them because it makes me ill.  Bottom line is, sometimes I wish I had a problem with you looking (or me thinking you're looking) at other men.  This advanced level of shit, flirting...  is really a bitch to deal with.  I don't know if you could handle it.  I wouldn't be so bold to try it either, I'd be shaking in my boots, scared of you and what you would do when we got away from that environment.  You feel good that I fear you?  Does it make you feel nice?  I hope not.  I shouldn't have to fear you.  You shouldn't have to fear me.  So, I work really hard to let you know that you do not have to fear me.  I tell you, I understand flirting is part of your nature.  I understand and work toward peace with it.  But I swear to god if you accuse me of looking at another woman...  GRRRRR.

I think playing a game without knowing your opponent, is a dangerous thing.  Actually, playing a game is dangerous no matter what...  It shouldn't be a game.  And if it is, we should at least be on the same team.  Try to understand what is going on with me when you 'think' something else is up...  Do you honestly think I would smile at a table of two other women?  Come on.  Get some more angels on your shoulder, and ask them...  'What do YOU guys think Brandon is doing' - hopefully they will say, 'Dear, don't let those demons fool you - he's clearly loving the time with you and your son, smiling because he's being a goofball with his food'  

Let me give you another example...  grocery shopping.  You fight, kick, and scream if I go without you to get some staples that we need.  Always saying that YOU want to do the shopping.  Ok, do the shopping.  But, get the fucking staples!  I could get mad at you for yesterday, since we have about 100 different teas in the fridge, and no hash browns.  But, I don't care.  I laugh at it.  I know your answer already.  It's fine, I'll go today and get hash browns, milk, peanut butter, etc.  So a hefty man can live around here.  How do you guys survive on tea? :)

You just woke up and came in here.  I'm going to wrap this up with some summarizing...  Hopefully it helps understand me a little better.  Hopefully it doesn't go forgotten...

-- I am human.  I cannot be expected to be anything other than human.
-- You are human.  I cannot expect you to be anything other than human.
-- I cannot MAKE love without love preceding it.  If we're MAD, help get us to LOVE, then we can MAKE LOVE.
-- You are beautiful, and I always try to tell you.  You mostly reply that you are not.  I think you deny it so much that sometimes you miss the fact that I just said something really nice to you.
-- I'm somewhat handsome, I guess.  I'll let you tell me any time of day, to soak it up...  to know that you still love me.
-- Tell the demons to shut the fuck up.  If I didn't slap mine in the kisser each time they start up, we would be miserable.
-- Sorry I did not pretty up my gifts like Molly did.  I wish I had more money and time to spend on it like she did.  Kudos to her.  Happy for you.  It broke my heart.
-- Be careful around other men, but don't change who you are completely for me.  Be yourself, try to be carefree.  But if you notice that I'm off in the corner, come get me and touch me as much as you just touched them.  Cut up with me as much as you cut up with them.  Definitely don't throw me under the bus in front of them by ignoring me, forgetting me, etc.
-- When you're shopping for us, get potatoes, meat, and things that caveman likes.  Caveman starve on tea and lettuce.
-- When we're out, remember I'm living in fear of your demons.  Don't let them win, I'll take care of you the best I can.  Don't destroy me and our time for me smiling at our son.
-- When we're being LOVE, lets make some fucking LOVE!

That is all, going to print this and present it to you.

I love you, Christina.  Lets have a good holiday break and let me get that basement sorted a bit.

Smooches.
Brandon
